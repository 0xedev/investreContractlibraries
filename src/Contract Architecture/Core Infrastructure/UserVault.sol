 * @title UserVault (cloneable)
 * @notice Minimal, secure per-user vault meant to be cloned via EIP-1167 (WalletManager).
 *         Initialize once via `initialize(owner_)`.
 *
 * Security notes:
 *  - This contract is intentionally small and avoids full OpenZeppelin upgradeable patterns
 *    to keep clone bytecode minimal. It implements a simple initializer guard.
 *  - Owner controls funds; ActionExecutor should be whitelisted off-chain/onchain to call `executeCall`
 *    or Gnosis-style multisig flows should be used if you want shared control.
